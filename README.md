This repository contains a simple R script demonstrating a common error encountered when subsetting data frames. The script attempts to subset a data frame based on a condition that does not match any rows, resulting in an empty data frame. The solution shows a method for gracefully handling this scenario by checking the dimension of the resulting subset before proceeding with further analysis.
